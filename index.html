<h4>This site contains the general information for the 2019 Parallel Computing School, put on by ACENET.</h4>

<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
The ACENET Parallel Computing School seeks to educate researchers in those tools and techniques used in high-performance computing and scientific computation. Topics will include general parallel computing, OpenMP, GPGPU, and Message Passing Interface (MPI). The mornings will consist of lectures, with the afternoons following a lab format, where participants will be given exercises, or can bring specific problems to instructors related to their research.
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
 Participants attending the school must have familiarity with the Unix command line, and some level of programming experience. Participating in the ACENET Basics Series would be a great foundation for the school. <strong>Laptop required.</strong>
</p>

<!--
  LOCATION

  This block displays the address and links to maps showing directions
  if the latitude and longitude of the workshop have been set.  You
  can use http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html to find the lat/long of an
  address.

<!--
  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  Modify the block below if there are any special requirements.
-->
<p id="requirements">
  <strong>Requirements:</strong> Participants must have a Compute Canada account. They must bring a laptop with a
  Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges
  on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed
  <a href="#setup">below</a>). They are also required to abide by
  Software Carpentry's
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.

  ETHERPAD

  At `_misc/etherpad.txt` you will find a template for the etherpad.

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in the ACENET Parallel Computing School, you must have
  an active Compute Canada account, your own laptop computer, and suitable software installed
  on it to SSH to a Compute Canada cluster.
